I've continued to be inspired by the infamous [important videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXKAG8g1Ls_Ax-SU7rCgyiGWjylB5NHL-) playlist on YouTube. For a few years I've been curating my own collection of videos I deem to very important.

I'm terrified to introduce to you the videos in my own important videos playlist.

Here we go.

## Pop culture essays

Video essays. Mini docs. Opinion videos. Whatever we want to call these things, this is totally my shit.  
Really focused videos about stuff that I love. I remember when I first watched all the videos for [Everything's a Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc&list=PLDQ6BYd73QHxgeNJPX8yZRcp8wF_B_tph) and being totally impressed.

### Jackie Chan - How to Do Action Comedy

Every frame a painting came afterwards and I don't know why, it just resonated with me more.

## Makes me laugh ðŸ˜‚

These videos always make me laugh.

### Larry David Becomes Kevin Roberts - SNL

It's extremely difficult for me to feel bad after watching Larry David break into laughter over and over again. Essential sad day remedy.

### Watch Ryan Gosling Lose It Over Greg Davies' Drunk Tale - The Graham Norton Show

Probably the best talk show on TV; put all them famous people together, give them some drinks and just put it all on TV. Awesome.

## Weird + Mesmerizing AF

Videos I have wanted to share with you but there's literally never an appropriate time or context to do so.

### Bounce

I mean come on:

- Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
- The dancing is fire
- Wholesome story of two brothers just being proud of each other with very similar dads
- Weird AF

### Get tf out of my way type way

This video says, "Hey, believe in yourself."
