          I build websites and apps but mainly my focus is on building
          interfaces &mdash; UI should look good, feel good, and deliver the
          best possible experience for people using it. Sure, I can build an API
          or tinker with some middleware but my jam is all about the clicky,
          touchy, visual parts of the web.

          Currently, I work at Accenture Interactive and collaborate with other

          A little more about me: I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada.
          These days I'm working and living in Austin, Texas with a modest
          collection of succulents and houseplants (it's the Texas way I
          suppose). You can find me enjoying stuff like{' '}
